            <img class="portfolio-feature" src="../img/slider/vlc-course-development.jpg" alt="VLC" />
            <p>This project was for the <span>North Carolina Community College System</span> via <span>Fayetteville Technical Community College</span>. We developed five different online learning courses. The courses were Math 263 (Calculus), Sociology 210, Art 115, Biology 168 (Biology 1) and Biology 169 (Biology 2). We built these courses using <span>Adobe Edge Animate, jQuery, HTML and CSS.</span> The audio was produced in Adobe Audition. I was the <span>Lead Web Developer, Audio Editor and Project Manager</span> from the begninng of this project until delivery. </p>

            <p>This project was one of two projects that I helped manage and develop for <span>Verizon Wireless</span>. Immersion was responsible for creating all of the 3D portion of this application along with the near real-time 2D racing experience. This application was a very large project and employed several technologies. We built the 3D assets in <span>3DS Max, Unity</span> and programmed against them in <span>C#</span>. The 2D racing experience was created in <span>Java</span> for the Android platform and <span>Objective-C</span> for the iOS platform. I was the <span>Lead
                    3D Developer, Project Manager and Unity Developer</span> for this project. I was also responsible for application deployment, source control, code merging and quality assurance. I upheld these responsiblities from the beginning of the project until delivery.</p>
